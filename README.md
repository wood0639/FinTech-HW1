# FinTech BootCamp HW1
## Overview and Origin

*Name of company? 

Morningstar

*When was the company incorporated? 

The company was founded on May 16, 1984 in Chicago, IL.

*Who are the founders of the company? 

Joe Mansueto is the founder of Morningstar Research. He started and ran it with 7 employees out of his apartment.

*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

Joe was a stock analyst that thought it was unfair for the big investment institutions to have access to more in-depth stock information. He then decided to start Morningstar to provide detailed info and analysis to the retail investor.

*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

 Currently the company is publicly traded, and they have a current market cap of $10.07 Billion.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Morningstar set out to bring world-class investment information to everyone, anyone from the everyday average retail investor, financial advisor, or financial institution.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company wants to offer its products and services to all levels of investors.  While I cannot provide a number to associate to the market demand of their product, the potential of their reach is massive.  According to their website, they are utilized in 27 different countries and have covered 621,370 investments.
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

I believe Morningstar's advantage is that they offer and promote their services to the average joe, rather than institutions like Bloomberg. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
