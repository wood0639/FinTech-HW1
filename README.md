# FinTech BootCamp HW1
## Overview and Origin

* ### Name of company?
    Morningstar

* ### When was the company incorporated? 
    The company was founded on May 16, 1984 in Chicago, IL.

* ### Who are the founders of the company? 
    Joe Mansueto is the founder of Morningstar Research. He started and ran it with 7 employees out of his apartment.

* ### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
    Joe was a stock analyst that thought it was unfair for the big investment institutions to have access to more in-depth stock information. He then decided to start Morningstar to provide detailed info and analysis to the retail investor.

* ### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    Currently the company is publicly traded, and they have a current market cap of $10.07 Billion.

## Business Activities:

* ### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    Morningstar set out to bring world-class investment information to everyone, anyone from the everyday average retail investor, financial advisor, or financial institution.

* ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    The company wants to offer its products and services to all levels of investors.  While I cannot provide a number to associate to the market demand of their product, the potential of their reach is massive.  According to their website, they are utilized in 27 different countries and have covered 621,370 investments.

* ### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    I believe Morningstar's advantage is that they offer and promote their services to the average joe, rather than institutions like Bloomberg. 

* ### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    They utilize a whole host of different technologies.  Here are just a few of the ones currently utilized:
     JQuery, 
     PHP,
     NGINX, 
     Java, 
     CloudFlare,
     Apache HTTP Server,
     Bootstrap, &
     AngularJS


## Landscape:

* ### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    Morningstar is involved in the Equities and Investments Research.

* ### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    The biggest change to their business (as well as every other business) has been the development of mobile-based applications for their customer-base.  They also continually innovate new ways to offer different, sophisticated tools to analyze investment opportunities


* ### What are the other major companies in this domain? 
    Morningstar's current major competitor's are Bloomberg, L.P., MarketWatch, Inc., and Thomson Reuters Corp.


## Results

* ### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    They allow investors from all walks of life to compete in an ever-fiercer investment environment.  

* ### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?  
    Morningstar is the leader in independent investment research in North America.  I believe they have found their niche in their sector by targeting the retail sector.


## Recommendations

* ### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
    I think they maybe be able to disrupt their space by finding a way to offer their products and services free to retail investors.  They may be able to monetize user data in exchange for their clientele utilizing their services.  In this way, they could become the Robinhood of the investment research space. 

* ### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    This could serve to exponentially expand their userbase and create a shakeup in the equities research environment, much like Robinhood did to traditional stock brokerage companies.

* ### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    This would have to utilize data gathering technologies employed by tech giants such as Facebook or Google, suchas tracking people's phones, browsing history, purchase history, investment history, and GPS movement.    

* ### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    This would allow them to securely offer the End user a free solution in exchange for this information.  It would also empower them to be able to use AI to predict individual and institutional investment sentiment, which would be a powerful tool to get in investment's before the rest of the market.
