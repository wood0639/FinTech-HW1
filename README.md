Joe Mansueto is the founder of Morningstar Research. He started and ran it with 7 employees out of his apartment.

* ### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Morningstar set out to bring world-class investment information to everyone, anyone from the everyday average retail investor, financial advisor, or financial institution.

* ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The company wants to offer its products and services to all levels of investors.  While I cannot provide a number to associate to the market demand of their product, the potential of their reach is massive.  According to their website, they are utilized in 27 different countries and have covered 621,370 investments.

* ### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
I believe Morningstar's advantage is that they offer and promote their services to the average joe, rather than institutions like Bloomberg.

## Recommendations

* ### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
I think they maybe be able to disrupt their space by finding a way to offer their products and services free to retail investors.  They may be able to monetize user data in exchange for their clientele utilizing their services.  In this way, they could become the Robinhood of the investment research space.investment

This could serve to exponentially expand their userbase and create a shakeup in the equities research environment, much like Robinhood did to traditional stock brokerage companies.
